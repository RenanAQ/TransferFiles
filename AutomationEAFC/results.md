### General:
This study aims to examine how closely (or how far) a simulation game—in this case, EAFC24—resembles reality. 
My goal is to simulate one thousand tournaments and compare each team’s position with their actual position based on Premier League data.
I will also compare the results with the odds that were given at that time.

### Premises:

- EAFC24
- Team: Arsenal
- Simulation only
- Tournament mode
    - No Cup competitions
    - No International competition
    - No national competition
    - No transfer market

### Definitions:

- Fairline = “Fairline” in betting refers to the true or fair odds of an event, 
representing what the odds should be based on the actual probability of an outcome occurring. 
The concept of fairline is important because it helps bettors determine whether a bookmaker’s odds offer 
value or if they are skewed in the bookmaker’s favor.
To calculate a fairline, you need to convert the implied probability of an outcome into decimal odds. The formula is:

Fairline Odds = 1/Probability

- Expected Value (EV) = In betting, “EV” stands for Expected Value. It is a mathematical concept used 
to determine the average outcome of a bet if it were to be placed many times. 
EV helps bettors understand whether a bet is likely to be profitable in the long run.

EV = (Probability of Winning x Amount Won per Bet) - (Probability of Losing x Amount Lost per Bet)
