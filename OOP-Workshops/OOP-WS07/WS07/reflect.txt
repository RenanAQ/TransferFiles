In workshop 07, OOP concepts are utilized to create a structured and modular design for handling vehicles. 
The primary OOP concepts demonstrated here include class inheritance and encapsulation.
Inheritance is a concept where a class (derived class) inherits attributes and methods from another class (base class). 
In this workshop, the Truck class inherits from the MotorVehicle class. This means Truck inherits all the attributes 
(like license plate, address, and year built) and methods (such as moveTo, write, and read) of MotorVehicle. 
This promotes code reuse and logical organization. Truck can add new attributes (like capacity and cargo load) and methods (like addCargo and unloadCargo) 
while still using or overriding methods from MotorVehicle.
We also had encapsulation, which involves bundling data (attributes) and methods (functions) that operate on the data into a single unit, or class. 
Each class keeps its data members private or protected, exposing only necessary methods publicly. 
This is evident as both MotorVehicle and Truck have private attributes and public methods, controlling how the data is accessed and modified.
