I have done all the coding by myself and only copied the code that my professor provided
to complete my workshops and assignments.

In this workshop, I focused on developing my proficiency in dynamic memory management, file handling, and class design in C++. 
Through implementing the Text and HtmlText classes, I applied essential concepts such as the rule of three, which includes the copy constructor, copy assignment operator, and destructor. 
This ensures proper management of dynamically allocated memory, preventing memory leaks and ensuring deep copying of class objects.
In the Text class, I handled file operations by reading file contents into dynamically allocated memory and providing read-only access through the subscript operator. 
The HtmlText class, derived from Text, enhanced functionality by converting text file content into a simple HTML format. 
I overrode the write method to replace specific characters with their HTML equivalents, ensuring a seamless HTML conversion.
Throughout this workshop, I utilized the skills I acquired during the semester to effectively manage memory, handle file I/O operations, and implement class inheritance. 
By applying these concepts, I reinforced my understanding of dynamic memory allocation, class design, and inheritance in C++.
